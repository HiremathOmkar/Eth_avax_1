# Error Handling with require(), assert(), and revert()

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract that demonstrates error handling using the `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements. These statements play a vital role in ensuring the reliability and security of smart contracts by validating conditions, enforcing constraints, and handling errors gracefully.

## Smart Contract: MathOperation

The `MathOperation` smart contract showcases the usage of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` for various error handling scenarios.

### Function: `Division(uint256 _numerator, uint256 _denominator)`

This function performs safe division of two numbers while preventing division by zero.

- Parameters:
  - `_numerator`: The numerator for the division.
  - `_denominator`: The denominator for the division.

### Function: `check_even(uint256 _value)`

This function checks if a given value is even using the `assert()` statement.

- Parameters:
  - `_value`: The value to be checked.

### Function: `check_negetive(uint256 _input)`

This function checks if an input is negative and demonstrates the use of `revert()` to handle negative inputs.

- Parameters:
  - `_input`: The input value to be validated.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or create a new Solidity file with the provided code.
2. Deploy the `MathOperation` contract on a suitable Ethereum development environment.
3. Interact with the functions, providing sample inputs to observe the error handling mechanisms.

## Error Handling Strategies

- `require()`: Enforces preconditions and input validation before proceeding.
- `assert()`: Verifies internal state assumptions that should never be false.
- `revert()`: Explicitly halts execution and reverts transactions under specific conditions.
